          <h1>About Pokemon</h1>
          <p>
            Welcome to our Pokemon world! We are a group of Pokemon enthusiasts
            who love to explore the world of Pokemon and learn more about these
            amazing creatures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our mission is to provide information about Pokemon, their
            abilities, and their characteristics to help trainers become more
            knowledgeable about their favorite Pokemon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, there are known Pokemon species in the PokeAPI. We strive
            to keep our database up-to-date with the latest information about
            these creatures.
          </p>
          <p>
            We hope that our website will be a valuable resource for all Pokemon
            trainers, whether you're just starting your journey or you're a
            seasoned trainer looking to learn more about your favorite Pokemon.
